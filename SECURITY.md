# Security Measures in Journal App

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Journal App to protect user data and prevent common web vulnerabilities.

## Input Validation and Sanitization

1. **User Input Validation**
   - Client-side validation with HTML5 attributes and JavaScript
   - Server-side validation using custom validators
   - Pattern matching for usernames, emails, and passwords
   - Password strength requirements enforced
   - Content length limits to prevent abuse

2. **Content Sanitization**
   - HTML content sanitization using Bleach and html-sanitizer
   - URL parameter sanitization
   - Form data sanitization
   - File upload validation and sanitization

## Authentication and Authorization

1. **User Authentication**
   - Secure password hashing with Werkzeug
   - Password strength requirements enforced
   - Protection against common passwords
   - CSRF protection on all forms
   - Login throttling with rate limiting

2. **Password Reset and Email Change**
   - Secure token generation using secrets module
   - Time-limited tokens (24-hour expiry)
   - Email verification for changes
   - Prevention of timing attacks

3. **Session Security**
   - HTTP-only cookies
   - Secure cookies when using HTTPS
   - Session timeout (1 hour)
   - CSRF token validation

## Request and Response Security

1. **HTTP Security Headers**
   - Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
   - X-XSS-Protection
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - X-Frame-Options
   - Strict-Transport-Security
   - Referrer-Policy

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Login attempts limited to 5 per minute
   - Registration limited to 3 per minute
   - Password reset requests limited to 3 per minute
   - Password reset completions limited to 3 per hour
   - AI conversation API limited to 10 per minute
   - Global rate limit of 200 requests per hour

3. **CORS Protection**
   - Restrictive CORS policy for API endpoints
   - CSRF token validation for AJAX requests

## File and Database Security

1. **File Upload Protection**
   - File type validation
   - Secure filename generation with UUID
   - Size limitations
   - User-specific access control

2. **Database Security**
   - Parameterized queries (via SQLAlchemy ORM)
   - SQL injection protection
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - User-specific data access enforcement

3. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Secure error messages (no sensitive information)
   - Comprehensive logging of security events
   - Detection of potential attacks

## Additional Security Measures

1. **Security Monitoring**
   - Detection of suspicious SQL patterns
   - Detection of script injection attempts
   - Logging of security events

2. **User Privacy**
   - Data minimization
   - Clear data ownership (user-specific data access)
   - No sharing of data between users

## Future Improvements

1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
2. **Account lockout after multiple failed attempts**
3. **Regular security audits**
4. **Expanded rate limiting and protection against denial of service**
