## Critique Framework

Please provide a comprehensive analysis covering these areas:

### A. Test Architecture and Structure
1. **Test Organization**
   - Are tests logically organized and categorized?
   - Is the file structure clear and maintainable?
   - Are test classes and methods appropriately named?

2. **Test Configuration**
   - Evaluate the pytest configuration and fixtures
   - Assess database setup and isolation strategy
   - Review mock configuration and consistency

3. **Test Independence and Isolation**
   - Are tests properly isolated from each other?
   - Do tests have proper setup and teardown?
   - Are there any dependencies between tests?

### B. Test Coverage and Completeness
1. **Functional Coverage**
   - Are all major application features tested?
   - Are edge cases and error conditions covered?
   - Are both positive and negative test scenarios included?

2. **Test Depth**
   - Are tests testing the right level of functionality?
   - Are there appropriate unit vs integration test boundaries?
   - Are complex business logic scenarios adequately tested?

3. **Security Testing**
   - Are security features properly tested?
   - Is CSRF protection adequately validated?
   - Are authentication and authorization properly tested?

### C. Test Quality and Best Practices
1. **Test Clarity and Readability**
   - Are test names descriptive and clear?
   - Is test code easy to understand and maintain?
   - Are tests well-documented where necessary?

2. **Assertion Quality**
   - Are assertions specific and meaningful?
   - Do tests validate the right behaviors?
   - Are error messages helpful for debugging?

3. **Mock Usage**
   - Are mocks used appropriately and consistently?
   - Are external dependencies properly mocked?
   - Is mock setup and configuration clear?

### D. Database and State Management
1. **Database Testing**
   - Is the PostgreSQL test setup appropriate?
   - Are database transactions properly handled?
   - Is test data management effective?

2. **State Management**
   - Are tests properly managing application state?
   - Are user sessions and authentication properly handled?
   - Are cleanup procedures adequate?

### E. Performance and Maintainability
1. **Test Performance**
   - Are tests running efficiently?
   - Is the test suite scalable?
   - Are there any performance bottlenecks?

2. **Maintainability**
   - How easy would it be to add new tests?
   - Are test utilities and helpers well-designed?
   - Is the test codebase DRY and well-structured?

## Specific Issues to Investigate

Based on the current status, please pay special attention to:

1. **Why 45% of tests are failing** - Analyze failure patterns and root causes
2. **Test isolation issues** - Some tests pass individually but fail in groups
3. **Mock configuration problems** - Inconsistent mocking across test files
4. **Database relationship testing** - Complex foreign key and cascade scenarios
5. **Email and external service testing** - Service integration challenges
6. **Security test effectiveness** - Are security tests actually validating security?

## Output Format

Please structure your critique as follows:

### Executive Summary
- Overall assessment of test suite quality (1-10 scale)
- Top 3 strengths
- Top 3 critical issues requiring immediate attention

### Detailed Analysis
For each section (A-E above), provide:
- **Assessment:** Current state evaluation
- **Issues:** Specific problems identified with file/line references
- **Recommendations:** Concrete improvement suggestions

### Specific Test File Critiques
