# AI Conversation Setup Guide

## Overview
The journal application includes AI conversation functionality powered by Google's Gemini API. This allows you to have intelligent discussions about your journal entries.

## Current Status
✅ **AI conversation interface is working**  
✅ **API endpoint is implemented**  
✅ **Frontend integration is complete**  
✅ **AI models updated to latest Gemini 2.0 Flash**  
✅ **CSRF protection implemented**  
✅ **Full AI functionality working**  

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get a Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key

### 2. Configure the API Key
Add the API key to your environment:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Or create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Restart the Application
After setting the API key, restart the Flask application for the changes to take effect.

## How It Works

### Demo Mode
Without an API key, the AI conversation will run in demo mode with helpful mock responses.

### Full AI Mode
With a valid API key, the system will:
1. Analyze your journal entries
2. Understand context and emotions
3. Provide thoughtful insights and responses
4. Engage in meaningful conversations about your reflections

## Features

- **Single Entry Conversations**: Chat about specific journal entries
- **Multiple Entry Analysis**: Analyze patterns across multiple entries  
- **Suggested Questions**: Pre-built conversation starters
- **Real-time Chat Interface**: Interactive conversation experience
- **Context Awareness**: AI understands your journal content and emotions

## Accessing AI Conversations

1. Go to any journal entry detail page
2. Click the "AI Conversation" button
3. Or visit `/ai/simple` for quick access
4. Type your questions and get AI insights!

## Troubleshooting

- **404 Error**: Make sure the application is restarted after adding the API route
- **Demo Mode**: Check that GEMINI_API_KEY is properly set in environment
- **Rate Limiting**: Wait if you see 429 errors from too many requests

## Recent Fixes (June 2025)

✅ **Updated AI Models**: Upgraded from outdated Gemini 1.0/1.5 models to latest Gemini 2.0 Flash models  
✅ **Fixed Model Compatibility**: Resolved "Sorry, I couldn't generate a response" errors  
✅ **Added CSRF Protection**: Secured API endpoints against CSRF attacks  
✅ **Improved Error Handling**: Better debugging and fallback responses  

## Test Results
