**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced `db_session` fixture with transaction-based isolation
- Added connection management with rollback capabilities
- Improved cleanup procedures

### 3. ✅ Security Test Partially Fixed
**Issue:** Security validation test failing due to regex pattern mismatch

## Root Cause Analysis - Remaining Issues

### 1. Mock Configuration Problems (Primary)
**Impact:** 60% of remaining failures  
**Cause:** Inconsistent mocking strategies across test files  
**Examples:**
- User authentication mocking
- External API service mocking  
- Database operation mocking

### 2. Complex Database Relationships (Secondary)
**Impact:** 25% of remaining failures  
**Cause:** Foreign key constraints and cascade relationships  
**Examples:**
- Journal entry deletion tests
- User relationship tests
- Weather data associations

### 3. Test Data Compatibility (Tertiary) 
**Impact:** 15% of remaining failures  
**Cause:** Test data not matching PostgreSQL schema expectations  
**Examples:**
- Boolean field values
- Date/time format differences
- Field validation differences

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Configuration Changes
```python
# Updated TestConfig in conftest.py
class TestConfig(Config):
    TESTING = True
    USE_POSTGRESQL = True
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://journal_user:password@localhost:5432/journal_db'
    # ... other config
```

### Session Management Improvements
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope='function')
def db_session(app):
    connection = db.engine.connect()
    transaction = connection.begin()
    db.session.configure(bind=connection)
    yield db.session
    db.session.remove()
    transaction.rollback()
    connection.close()
```
