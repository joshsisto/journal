Dependency Check Findings:

1.  **Package:** `werkzeug`
    *   **Version:** 2.3.7
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **CVE-2023-46136**: Inefficient algorithmic complexity in the multipart data parser, leading to Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker can send crafted multipart data to consume excessive CPU time.
        *   **CVE-2024-49767**: Resource allocation without limits or throttling in `formparser.MultiPartParser()`, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting system memory with specially crafted form submissions.
        *   **CVE-2023-25577**: High resource usage when parsing multipart form data with many fields, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).
        *   **CVE-2024-49766**: Directory Traversal vulnerability due to a bypass for `os.path.isabs()` in the `safe_join()` function (on Windows systems using Python versions prior to 3.11).
    *   **Recommended Version to Upgrade To:** 2.3.8, 3.0.1, or higher (3.0.6 or higher addresses most of these issues).

2.  **Package:** `flask`
    *   **Version:** 2.3.3
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** No direct vulnerability found for this specific version. CVE-2023-30861 was fixed in 2.3.2.
    *   **Recommended Action:** While not directly vulnerable, it is always best practice to use the latest stable version to benefit from ongoing security improvements and bug fixes.

3.  **Package:** `flask-wtf`
    *   **Version:** 1.2.1
