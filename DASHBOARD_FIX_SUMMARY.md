# Dashboard CSRF Token Display Issue - Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
An unwanted long string was appearing above the text box for entering journal entries on the dashboard at https://journal.joshsisto.com/

## Root Cause
The issue was in `/home/josh/Sync2/projects/journal/templates/dashboard.html` on line 390, where the CSRF token was being rendered as plain text instead of being properly hidden in a form field.

**Problem Code:**
```html
<form method="POST" action="{{ url_for('journal.dashboard') }}" id="quickJournalForm">
    {{ csrf_token() }}
```

This caused the CSRF token (a long string like `IjNkMjkwNDJjYzJhOTc5Y2ZjMDM5N2U3ODk1ZDYwNGYzMGNlNjNiNWMi.aGs_Xg.VPIJmLhfsuu6Eul9THCo-Tsbw7w`) to be displayed as visible text above the writing area.

## Solution Applied
Fixed the CSRF token rendering by properly hiding it in a form field:

**Fixed Code:**
```html
<form method="POST" action="{{ url_for('journal.dashboard') }}" id="quickJournalForm">
    <input type="hidden" name="_csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token() }}">
```

## Verification
1. **Before Fix**: Debug analysis showed 1 long unwanted string appearing above the writing area
2. **After Fix**: Debug analysis showed 0 long unwanted strings
3. **Service**: Application was restarted using `python3 deploy_changes.py`
4. **Confirmation**: The CSRF token is now properly hidden in the form field and no longer visible to users

## Files Modified
- `/home/josh/Sync2/projects/journal/templates/dashboard.html` - Line 390

## Result
The unwanted CSRF token string no longer appears above the journal entry text box. The form still functions correctly with proper CSRF protection, but the token is now hidden as it should be.

## Screenshot
A verification screenshot `dashboard_fixed_20250706_203138.png` was taken showing the dashboard without the unwanted string.
